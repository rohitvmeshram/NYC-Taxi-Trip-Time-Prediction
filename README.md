# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction
The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help them in predicting the trip duration of taxi. This would in turn help them in matching the right cabs with the right customers quickly and efficiently.
The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this project. Based on individual trip attributes, you should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.
